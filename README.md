# mousenscroll
This script will depress the scroll lock key twice, enabling and disabling scroll lock. Slight overkill, inlcluding any mouse movement, but it should not be noticeable. This will prevent the screen from locking for just about any setup.  Just right click and choose Run with PowerShell when you want to keep your screen from locking.
